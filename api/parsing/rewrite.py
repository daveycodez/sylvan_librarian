"""Post-parse query rewriting: expand derived predicates into subtrees of primitives.

Applied once at the shared parse seam (`parse_scryfall_query`), so both the production
hand parser and the legacy pyparsing parser get identical treatment: the transform
operates on the common AST, after parsing and before SQL / Rust-engine serialization
(`parse => transform => rest`). Nothing parser-specific lives here.

Each expansion is written as a DSL string and re-parsed with the production parser, so a
definition is expressed in the same language it targets and stays correct by construction
(no hand-built node trees to drift). Every entry is count-validated against Scryfall's
live API before landing -- the naive expansion is frequently ~97-99%, not exact -- with
the rationale and residuals recorded in docs/issues/00713-is-tag-recovery.md.

# `localizedname` is `printed_name_folded_id != NONE_STR`, "this printing carries a printed name",

# ENGLISH (om1/66 prints "Rhilex the Accursed" over Agent Venom), so it is not "non-English"; it is
# per-FACE, matching every Japanese transform printing whose printed names live on the faces and not
# at the top level; and `is:localizedname e:dsk` counts 1,917 printings there against the same 1,917
# in the bulk. Like `lang:`, its presence WIDENS the query to the foreign annex -- that is how
# api.scryfall.com answers 31,294 cards for it with no `lang:` term in sight.
#
# `unique` is "this card has been printed in exactly one SET" -- Scryfall's syntax page says so in
# as many words ("cards that have only been in a single set") -- and it is NOT prints=1: 2,847 of
# its own 16,318 have more than one printing. The set count spans every language, verified on the
# 130 cards whose only second set is a foreign-only promo (Salvat, ps11, pmei): Scryfall calls none

# `has:` was absent, and this server answers a no-match where api.scryfall.com answers a full list.
# `has:split` is the one that surfaced it (126 there, nothing here); it is not special.
#
# MEASURED against api.scryfall.com on 2026-08-17, over 22 values chosen to span every shape the
# `is:` vocabulary has -- derived layout predicates (`split`, `dfc`, `modal`, `meld`, `flip`,
# `leveler`), computed text predicates (`vanilla`, `frenchvanilla`, `permanent`, `spell`), importer
# booleans (`promo`, `digital`, `reprint`, `funny`, `token`, `extra`, `etched`, `hires`,
# `reserved`, `spotlight`, `masterpiece`) and the two set-shaped ones (`commander`, `firstprint`).
# `is:X` and `has:X` answered the SAME total_cards on all 22, with no disagreement anywhere:
#
#     is:permanent 26220 = has:permanent      is:frenchvanilla 1095 = has:frenchvanilla
#     is:split       126 = has:split          is:indicator      369 = has:indicator
#
# A value that is neither a `has:` presence test nor an `is:` tag is a 400 upstream and a warning
# here -- `has:flying` and `has:goblin` are both bad_request on api.scryfall.com -- so the alias
# widens the vocabulary without widening what counts as valid.
#

# precedence: `has:watermark` asks whether a watermark is PRESENT and must not become
