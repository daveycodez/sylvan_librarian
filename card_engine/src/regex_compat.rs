//! Query-regex compilation: accepting the dialect the SQL path accepts.
//!
//! `o:/.../` is documented against PostgreSQL's `~*`
//! (docs/changelog/2025-02-02-regex-search.md), and two things it accepts the
//! `regex` crate does not:
//!
//! - **Lookaround.** `(?!…)`, `(?=…)`, `(?<=…)`, `(?<!…)`. The `regex` crate
//!   omits these by design — they are what costs it its linear-time guarantee.
//!   Lookahead is on the documented feature list.
//! - **Word-boundary escapes.** ARE spells them `\y` and `\m`. `\y` has an exact
//!   `regex`-crate spelling, so it is rewritten in place; `\m` has none and
//!   becomes lookaround. (Their uppercase twins `\Y`/`\M`/`\Z` cannot be spelled
//!   in a query: api.scryfall.com lowercases the pattern, and so does `compile`.)
//!
//! And one thing NEITHER dialect has: Scryfall's `\s…` shorthands, which its own docs page
//! calls "not formal character classes, it is just shorthand we have added". They are expanded
//! here — see [`SCRYFALL_SHORTHANDS`].
//!
//! Both were engine *declines* — a `build_filter` error that
//! `_search`'s blanket handler turned into a silent PostgreSQL fallback. That
//! made the SQL path load-bearing for a documented feature rather than a
//! crash net.
//!
//! A pattern the `regex` crate accepts still compiles on it, unchanged. The
//! backtracking engine is entered only where the fast one cannot go, which
//! keeps every existing optimization — most importantly the #734 trigram
//! narrowing, whose `regex_syntax::parse` reads the same pattern string.
